# Sentiment-Analysis-Apple-M1
ADA Project for Text Mining. 

This project comes from an idea should I buy the new MacBook with new cross-era chips. Apple has released its cross era product with **Apple Silicon M1**. I'm curious about whether this new product is popular and what its reputation is. I want to see peopleâ€™s attitudes towards the new MacBook products. So, I collect the tweets about this topic and use a sentiment analysis model to predict their attitudes to support my decision. 

**The whole project should be divided by following steps:**

- **Step 1:** Pulling tweets about the products(Macbook with new M1 chips) from twitter
- **Step 2:** Building a model to do the sentiment analysis (with relevant dataset to train)
- **Step 3:** Combining the data and model to predict the sentiment of these tweets, and go to the conclusion.
